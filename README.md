# Webships Starter

The default site template of the [Webships](https://www.drupal.org/project/webships)
installer.

A web apps gallery with organizations, served through a documented API:

- JSON:API served from `/api`, and read-only.
- OAuth 2.0 with Simple OAuth and consumers, and HTTP Basic authentication.
- OpenAPI documents for JSON:API and REST, rendered with Swagger UI at
  `/api-docs`.
- The Drupal core administration theme for the back end and the front end.
- Search and views for browsing the gallery.
- Registration is closed: an administrator creates the accounts.

Everything comes from drupal.org.

## Install

With the [Webships Project](https://www.drupal.org/project/webships_project)
template:

```shell
ddev composer create-project drupal/webships_project:^1.0
ddev drush si -y webships --account-name=webmaster installer_site_template_form.add_ons=webships_starter
```

Or apply the recipe on an existing site:

```shell
ddev composer require drupal/webships_starter
ddev drush recipe recipes/webships_starter
```

## Write operations

JSON:API is read-only. Turn write operations on at
`/admin/config/services/jsonapi` only when the site needs them, and rebuild the
cache afterwards.

## Cross-origin requests

CORS lives in `sites/default/services.yml` under `cors.config`. No module or
recipe can ship it, so set it per site.
